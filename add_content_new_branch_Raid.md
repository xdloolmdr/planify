# **Managing Reminders in Planify**
Reminders in Planify help you stay on track by notifying you about important deadlines and upcoming tasks. This section provides step-by-step instructions for creating, customizing, and managing reminders.

## 1. Creating a New Reminder
To set a new reminder for a task, follow these steps:

Navigate to the Tasks tab in the app.
Select the task for which you want to set a reminder.
Tap the Add Reminder button (represented by a bell icon ðŸ“…).
Choose a date and time for your reminder using the calendar and clock interface.
Tap Save Reminder to confirm.
Practical Example:
Task: "Submit project proposal."
Reminder: "Set a reminder for March 5, 2024, at 10:00 AM to ensure you're notified before the deadline."
## 2. Viewing and Editing Reminders
You can view and edit your reminders anytime:

Go to the Reminders tab in the main menu.
Locate the reminder you want to modify in the list.
Tap on the reminder to open its details.
Adjust the date, time, or notification preferences, and tap Save Changes.
Tip:
To avoid overlapping reminders, set notifications at least 30 minutes apart for tasks scheduled close together.

## 3. Deleting a Reminder
If a reminder is no longer needed:

Open the Reminders tab.
Swipe left on the reminder you wish to delete (on mobile) or click the Delete icon (on desktop).
Confirm the deletion when prompted.
## 4. Setting Recurring Reminders
For tasks that occur regularly:

In the reminder setup screen, toggle the Repeat option.
Choose the recurrence interval (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly).
Save your changes.
Practical Example:
Task: "Weekly team meeting."
Reminder: "Set a recurring reminder every Monday at 9:00 AM."
